# Getting Started

---

## Welcome
Welcome to Echo documentation! Currently, the documentation is divided into three big sections, each detailing a component that can help you understand and use Echo:
1. If you are just starting and want to get something working, continue reading this [Getting Started](1-getting-started.md) section!
2. If you want to learn more about Echo and how it works internally, and you are already familiar with the basics, head on over to [Core Systems](2-core-systems.md) to see how the code is structured.
3. Finally, to construct beautiful scenes that you can render with Echo, you need the simple [Echo Description Language](3-echo-description-language.md) to communicate your cool ideas to the renderer and let it help you realize them!

## User Interface

If you are simply interested in rendering with Echo, and would like to use a nice graphical dashboard do to so (who doesn't), Echo has a convenient user interface (developed in `Echo.UserInterface`) to help you see your renders. This interface also extremely useful when working with code to visualize any error or performance regression.

The interface window is divided into areas, most of which are empty when you first launched the application. The first area that you will interact with is the `Scheduler`.
